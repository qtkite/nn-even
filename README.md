# nn-even
basic neural network using pytorch to determine if a number is even.

# training
generates a dataset from 1-1000 and optimises the model based on loss.  
after every iteration, the model.pth is updated with latest results.

# results
accurate for smaller numbers, need to improve algorithm for a larger range of cases.
